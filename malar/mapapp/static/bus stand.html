    The Tiruvannamalai bus stand serves as a vital hub, ensuring good connectivity to major towns and cities. However, the facility struggles with several challenges that diminish the experience for travelers. Food stalls, though numerous, fail to maintain acceptable quality standards, leaving passengers with limited hygienic options. The condition of the toilets is particularly concerning, with poor maintenance making them almost unusable for many. The bus stand is perpetually overcrowded, adding to the discomfort of commuters. Littering is rampant, with insufficient measures to address waste management, resulting in an unclean environment.
